ExpandAnimations is a LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org extension to expand animations before exporting to PDF. The extension adds a menu entry "Tools>>Add-ons>>Expand animations" in Impress. The generated PDF file is in the same folder as the source document.

**We are looking for contributors :)**.

It is a fork of an excellent macro written by Matthew Neeley (see <http://markmail.org/message/ewe336yoe6iennsf> and <https://gist.github.com/977752>).
The extension code was initially generated using the excellent BasicAddonBuilder (<http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/BasicAddonBuilder>),
