ExpandAnimations is a LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org extension to expand animations before exporting to PDF.
It is a fork of an excellent macro written by Matthew Neeley (see <http://markmail.org/message/ewe336yoe6iennsf> and <https://gist.github.com/977752>).

The extension adds a menu entry "Tools>>Add-ons>>Expand animations" in Impress. The generated PDF file is in the same folder as the source document.
